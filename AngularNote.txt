*Angular - Is a Front End development tool


*Basic commands in Angular
    1. to create an Angular project: ng new project-name
    2. To run an Angular project: ng serve
    3. To generate components: ng g component-name
    4. To generate Service : ng g s sevice-folder/service-name
    5. To generate build : ng build
*Basic Concept in Angular

    1. Module :- To import 3rd party libraries, also used to hold components
    2. Component :- Html,css,ts also have a selector 
    3. Selector :- To replace selector tag with its html page
    4. Decorator :- To hold meta data , Starts with symbol @
    5. Set path for component :- To view a component in another webpage
        -Use app.routingmodule.ts file
        -Use router-outlet selector in root component(AppComponent) : To navigate according to the user requested path
        -routerLink :- used to redirect from one page to another
    6. Data binding :- Data sharing within a component (how we sharing data between ts to html)
        - One way binding : data sharing in one direction
        ---------------------------------------------------
        - ts (component) to html (view) file
    Methods for data binding ts to html:-
        - String Interpolation : {{class property-name}}
        - Property Binding : [attribute-name]="property-name"
    Methods for data binding html to ts:-
        - Event Binding : (event-name)="function call"
        - Event Binding using $event: (event-name)="function name($event)"    
        - Event Binding using template referense variale: #variable-name
    7. Two way binding : data sharing in both direction
            :-ngModel : import FormsModule in AppModule
            :-[(ngModule)]="Class property"
    *  Angular forms :- 
        - Template Driven Forms 
        - Model Driven Forms   
    8. Dependency injection : To share data between depentent classes
        - constructor(access-specifier variable-name:class name){
            
        }    
    9. Angular services :   To share common logic with components  
    10. Angular Directives : DOM Manipulation
        * Component Directives
        * Structural Directives : to add or remove html items
            -ngFor = "let variable-name of array-name"
        * Attribute Directive : to apply style to html elements
            -ngClass    
    11. Parent child data sharing
        - Child to Parent communication:- @Output Decorator
        - Parent to child communication:- @Input Decorator
